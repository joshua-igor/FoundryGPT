# FoundryGPT (WIP)
This is a highly early FoundryVTT module to provide ChatGPT-like features inside FoundryVTT while being aware of context.

You first have to provide the module with your API Key, you can find it at https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
You can set the API Key on Foundry's Configuration, but the module also asks for you everytime you open Foundry and do not have a key set.
For now, the module shows a window so you can write what you want. You can open this window by pressing the shortcut (Default is Shift+Spacebar).
